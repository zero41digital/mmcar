# Development

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/theme-mix.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/theme-mix)

Hero includes a modern development workflow based on Webpack and laravel-mix which compiles Sass, ES6 JavaScript, handles production builds, watchers, multiple CSS themes and more. This entire workflow is contained into an installable package named `theme-mix`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

> Create a `webpack.mix.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
require('theme-mix')

// Enable sourcemaps
const { mix } = require('laravel-mix')
const sourceMapsInProduction = false
mix.sourceMaps(sourceMapsInProduction)
```

> Update `package.json` with the workflow:

```json
"scripts": {
  "development": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --progress
--hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js",
  "production": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --progress
--hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js",
  "watch": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --watch --progress
--hide-modules --config=node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.config.js"
},
```

## Workflow

### Build

> Development build:

```bash
npm run development
```

> Production build (includes extra minification, optimizations and cleanup):

```bash
npm run production
```

### Watch

> Start a web server and automatically rebuild your changes as you make them:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Tasks

> Run specific tasks

```bash
npm run development -- --env.run [html|js|sass|copy|clean]
```

## Options

> Create a `theme-mix.yaml` file at the root of your project. These are the default configuration options, except `copy` which by default is an empty list.
